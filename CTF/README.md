# :muscle: CTF Study Good Writing Sharing 

##### A lot of thought occurred while creating the forensic CTF Quiz. Solving Quiz and making them it's night and day difference That was unfamiliar and very difficult for me. It's not perfect yet, but I've come across some good sites while I've been making them. I would like to share this site. <br><br>

##### In fact, I had a lot of difficulties while making it, and it was difficult because there was not much information. All my hard work went down the drain. If you want to create a digital forensics-related Quiz, it would be good to refer to the site below. <br><br>

##### First of all, I tried to write an article, but in fact, there are many more geniuses and smarter people than I am. So there are a lot of people who have compiled it so well, so I'll put a link here. <br><br>

##### The people in the link below were really kind and gave us good content. We should thank you for writing this. We should also create a good environment by sharing the skills we learned later. Once again, thank you very much to those who wrote a good article in the link below.<br><br>

##### I haven't finished it yet, but I will share it with you if I make a ctf challenge quiz later.<br><br>
